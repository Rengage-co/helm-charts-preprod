### ðŸ“Œ Minimum System Requirements

To successfully run the Rengage CE charts in a Kubernetes cluster, the following minimum system resources are required:

- **Option 1: Single node**
  - 16 CPU cores
  - 64 GB memory

- **Option 2: Multi-node cluster**
  - At least 2 Kubernetes worker nodes
  - Each with:
    - 8 CPU cores
    - 32 GB memory

These requirements ensure that all services can be scheduled and operate reliably under lightweight workloads. For production deployments with higher traffic or larger datasets, consider provisioning additional resources.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add rengage-preprod https://Rengage-co.github.io/helm-charts-preprod

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
rengage` to see the charts.

Before running the helm install, you need to execute the following command to load the Firebase service_account information. To create the required `secret.yaml` file, please contact our support team. 

    kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
